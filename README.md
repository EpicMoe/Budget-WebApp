This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and CSS styling. 
Through hands-on development, I've gained valuable insights into creating dynamic and responsive web applications. The process 
has not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of clean, maintainable code.
